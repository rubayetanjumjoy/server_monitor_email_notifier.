# Server Monitor & Email Notifier

## Overview

The Server Monitor & Email Notifier is a Python script that allows you to monitor the status of a remote server and receive email notifications when issues occur. This script leverages the FastAPI framework to create a web application and periodically checks the server's status using HTTP requests.

## Features

- **FastAPI Web Application**: The script creates a FastAPI web application with a "/check" endpoint to verify the server's running status.
- **Server Status Monitoring**: It periodically checks the server's status by sending HTTP requests to a specified URL.
- **Email Notification**: Email notifications are sent using the SMTP protocol. Users can configure SMTP server settings, email sender, email recipient, and credentials for sending email alerts.
